## table 
The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
X A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
X Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
X You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
X For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.
