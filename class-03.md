### list 
list is a way that we use to make words or sentences in ordered way and it may or may not have numeric or alphabet to give it order 
ul for order with dot, ol for numbaric order, dl , dt and dd to list a definition with explanation of it 
### boxs 
the css see every element on html as box so you have to use this feature to make your design and you can use it in different way to make the height and weight specific or to have space between boxes 
also you can but border on box with different color and width that will gives element beautiful look 
to make the border less sharpness you can make round corner 
and you can control of the place of next box if you want it under or beside the first box
### Decisions and Loops 
when you work in any thing on life you may have to make a decisions and it will depend on some information or input and when talk about it in programing language there are must be logical thing to make decision for that we use if statement and it will be controlled with logical operation furthermore we use switch if we know the specific case of operation not a wide range .
sometimes we have to do iteration till something happen or after a number of time for that we can use for statement to do operation number of time and while and do while to do operation till something happen
