## Functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### pure functions 

one of the thing that make the functional programming and it have two point

#### It returns the same result if given the same arguments 

#### It does not cause any observable side effects

### Immutability

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

### Referential transparency

This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.

### Functions as first-class entities

Functions as first-class entities can:

#### refer to it from constants and variables

#### pass it as a parameter to other functions

#### return it as result from other functions

### Higher-order functions

When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:

#### takes one or more functions as arguments, or

#### returns a function as its result
